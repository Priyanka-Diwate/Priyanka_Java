
Who to create project on eclipse--

Open eclipse >> go to file >> new >> project >> Go to java - select java project >> click next >> give the project name - It can be started with $, numbers etc.---PD
Spaces are not allowed in the name 

==========================================================================
(When we give project name it has identifiers
Identifiers -also known as nomenclature
= it is name of object or variable or name of method or class or package name , or a project name
They can be letters , $ , _ etc  (spaces are not allowed)
==========================================================================

System is create with project name - having JRE and SRC inside it
==========================================================================
When new project is created it has -
JRE system library - all the java related dependencies in jar format are created under this 
(additional dependencies can be given as required)
SRC- 
Suppose our project is a country then-
states under that are packages 
cities under that are called classes
(Project > package > classes) 
==============================================================================

Create new package for project 
Right click on SRC >> new  
Click on package >> create a package here >> give name (No space is allowed) >> click finish >> package is created under SRC 
create one more package >> naming OOPsPrinciples >>


now create a class 
Package can have multiple classes 
Right click on any package >> new >> Create class >> give name>> click finish 


Main method is created for the project
>> New screen is opened >> this shows the method created
While creating class - we can check the box 'public static void main' - (this is syntax for mainMethod) so this comes by default
OR
as of now we can write 'main' and give CTR space and enter (this will also bring that same thing) = syntax with PSVM is created.


Under PSVM access specifiers are used- 

Private 
OR
protected 
OR 
static void main (string {} args) -->(This one is said to be default)
==================================================================================
Meaning of whole main method -
Access specifiers :- 
1. Private - scope within class
2. Default - scope within package
3. protected - scope within package by using inheritance with other packages
4. public - scope with in 
==================================================================================


Under any method 
when we use syso + ctrl +space - it will brig system.out.println(); (whatever you write in its paranthesis in double cot, that is title)


We can have multiple methods into the project >>
main method is method under which we specify which method need to be run.


Statis method can be only called under main static method
when we want to call non static method/variable into static - we need to create object 



When we give variable into method and call it then it take variable from method itself (local variable)
but if variable is not given into method and we call it then it will take from main method (global variable)

========================================================
Creating another class under same package 

We can run other class method into 1st created class main method as well.

Constructor - When we dont create construtor, system create a constructor itself 
That cannot be seen but will be used while running , this is called as defualt constructor

When class name and method name is seen same , then it is a constructor.
